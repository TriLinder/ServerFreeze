# ServerFreeze
 A Minecraft datapack that freezes a server when nobody is online.



When no players is detected, the daylight and the weather cycle will be automatically frozen.

When a player logs on, the daylight and the weather cycle will be resumed into their previous state.

The datapack ignores players with the `doFreeze` tag, so you can try it out.

**NOTE: Forceloaded chunks will NOT be frozen**



**How to use:**

1. Install the datapack
2. Done! No configuration required!
